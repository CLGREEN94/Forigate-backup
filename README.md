# Forigate-backup

The Forigate backup system. (For Lunix)

The guy overhere (http://www.jfinley.com/) was the one with the orgianl code. 

This is a perl script that will log into a ForiGate Firewall and then do magical backup things. I mean the last thing anyone wants now is the backup to vanish.

#Settings

**Note:** _It’s suggested to set the other trusted to be 255.255.255.255/255.255.255.255_

**TIP:** _If you change your Fortigate SSH port, adjust the PERL script “port=>22” to the appropriate port as needed._

I have saved this script on the server as **foribkup.pl**

To run the script I do the following command **_perl /home/bk/script/forigate/foribkup.pl_**
